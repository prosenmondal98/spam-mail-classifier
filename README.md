# spam-mail-classifier
### Overview:
This project aims to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam), providing a first line of defense against unwanted messages.
### Features:
1. Data Cleaning: Rigorously cleaned and preprocessed the raw SMS data, making it apt for analysis and modeling.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Engaged in EDA to gain insights from the dataset, visualizing the distribution of spam and ham messages.
3. Word Cloud Visualization: Extracted a word cloud to visually represent the most frequent terms in spam messages.
4. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Leveraged the NLTK library to tokenize messages, remove stopwords, and stem/lemmatize words, preparing the data for machine learning.
5. Machine Learning Models: Implemented and evaluated multiple Naive Bayes classifiers, including:
Gaussian Naive Bayes
Multinomial Naive Bayes
Bernoulli Naive Bayes
### Tools & Libraries:
Python
Pandas
NLTK
Scikit-learn
WordCloud
Matplotlib
Seaborn
### Future Scope:
Explore advanced deep learning models like RNNs and LSTMs for classification.
Implement feature engineering to extract more relevant features from messages
